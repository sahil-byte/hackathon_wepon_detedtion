# hackathon_wepon_detection
Hope fully a weapon detection system.

We are making a wepon detection system.

## Starting with a small step

first i am going to make a person detetection module with OpenCV using Transfer Learning(pre existing modules of MobileNetSSD), due to time constraint. 

we are done with the training and weight files and config files.

### Weight file not missing.

Did'nt uploaded the weight file of yolo due to large file size.(But we desided to upload it anyway.) 

## And Dataset ?

that was even more heavy.
